    "### User-Defined Functions\n",
    "Function in PL/pgSQL are similar to ordinary programming functions that realize a certain functionality. A Function consist of two main elements:\n",
    "- Header Section\n",
    "- Body Section\n",
    "\n",
    "A function definition:\n",
    "```\n",
    "create [or replace] function function_name(param_list)\n",
    "   returns return_type \n",
    "   language plpgsql\n",
    "  as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "declare \n",
    "-- variable declaration\n",
    "begin\n",
    " -- logic\n",
    "end;\n",
    "$$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**\n",
    "- A function can have zero or many parameters\n",
    "- Returned data type must be specified\n",
    "- Laguage must be specified as well. Not only plpgsql can be used.\n",
    "- Parameters can have the following notations:\n",
    "    - **Positional Notation** ( func_name(a, b) )\n",
    "    - **Named Notation** ( func_name(arg_1:=a, arg_2:=b )\n",
    "    - **Mixed Notation** (Combination of Positional and Named notations)\n",
    "- Default parameters can be defined (e.g. ```date DATE DEFAULT NOW()```)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### RETRUN AND RETURN NEXT\n",
    " ```RETURN``` and ```RETURN NEXT``` are commands responsible for returning values from a function. There are some differences between them. ```RETURN``` stops a function execution and returns output variables.```RETURN NEXT``` returns a value and puts it in a final output set (mostly used in loops) where the data is accumulated.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Function Parameter Modes\n",
    "Parameters which a function take in can have 3 main modes:\n",
    "- ```IN``` - can be only used as input parameters ( this type is set by default)\n",
    "- ```OUT``` - can be only used as output parameters\n",
    "- ```INOUT``` - can be used as input parameters, then be updated and returned\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- More info: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/plpgsql-function-parameters/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Overloading\n",
    "Multiple functions can share the same names as long as they have different arguments. These function names are overloaded.\n",
    "- More info: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/plpgsql-function-overloading/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions Returning a Table\n",
    "- https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/plpgsql-function-returns-a-table/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Dropping\n",
    "To drop a function, use the following syntax:\n",
    "```\n",
    "drop function [if exists] function_name(argument_list)\n",
    "[cascade | restrict]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- More info: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-drop-function/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure Creation\n",
    "The main drawback of functions: they **can't execute transactions** (you can't start, commit or rollback a transaction).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Procedure Creation Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "create [or replace] procedure procedure_name(parameter_list)\n",
    "language plpgsql\n",
    "as $$\n",
    "declare\n",
    "-- variable declaration\n",
    "begin\n",
    "-- stored procedure body\n",
    "end; $$\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedures must be called:\n",
    "```call stored_procedure_name(argument_list);```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**\n",
    "- A procedure doesn't return a value. If provide ```RETURN``` is stops a transaction immediately.\n",
    "- Parameters in procedures can have only ```IN``` and ```OUT``` modes\n",
    "- The basic example of a procedure is money transfer from a sender to a reciever\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure Deletion\n",
    "The syntax is pretty straightforward:\n",
    "```\n",
    "drop procedure [if exists] procedure_name (argument_list)\n",
    "[cascade | restrict]\n",
    "```\n",
    "- More info: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-drop-procedure/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cursors\n",
    "Cursor allows **encapsulating a query and process each individual row at a time.** Normally, cursors are used when we have to **divide a large result set into parts and process each part individually.** The following picture describes how cursors can be used:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/cursor.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"700\"/>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Cursors can be:\n",
    "- **Unbound Cursor** (These cursors are just declared and aren't bound to any queries)\n",
    "- **Bound Cursor** (These cursors are bounded to a query in ```DECLARE```)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Declaring a Cursor**\n",
    "\n",
    "```cursor_name [ [no] scroll ] CURSOR [( var_1 datatype, Var_2 data type, ...)] FOR query;```\n",
    "- ```scroll``` defines whether a cursor can be scrolled back or not \n",
    "\n",
    "A Cursor can take in variables\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A cursor must be defined in ```DECLARE```\n",
    "2. It must be opened \n",
    "3. Rows can be accessed using ```FETCH, MOVE, UPDATE, or DELETE``` statements\n",
    "\n",
    "```FETCH``` gets the next row from the cursor and assigns it a **target_variable** that can be:\n",
    "- Record Variable\n",
    "- Row Type Variable\n",
    "- A comma-separated list of variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a cursor is positioned we can **delete or update row** identifying by the cursor using:\n",
    "- ```DELETE WHERE CURRENT OF```\n",
    "- ```UPDATE WHERE CURRENT OF```\n",
    "\n",
    "It's similar to ```WHERE col_name = value``` but here we don't have to provide a row address due to the cursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "UPDATE film \n",
    "SET release_year = p_year \n",
    "WHERE CURRENT OF cur_films;\n",
    "```\n",
    "- More info: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/plpgsql-cursor/\n",
    "\n",
    "```FETCH``` has the following options:\n",
    "- ```FETCH FIRST``` - always returns the first row of a cursor\n",
    "- ```FETCH LAST``` - always returns the last row of a cursor\n",
    "- ```FETCH PRIOR``` - returns a prior row of a cursor\n",
    "- ```FETCH NEXT``` - returns the next row of a cursor\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cursor Moving**\n",
    "- ```MOVE FORWARD 3 FROM my_cursor INTO my_variable``` - moves a cursor on 3 rows forward\n",
    "- ```MOVE BACKWARD 3 FROM my_cursor INTO my_variable``` - moves a cursor on 3 rows backward\n",
    "- ```MOVE RELATIVE 2/-2 FROM my_cursor INTO my_variable``` - moves a cursor using a relative position"
