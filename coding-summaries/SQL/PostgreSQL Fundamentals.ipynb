    "### PostgreSQL Fundamentals\n",
    "### Relational Database\n",
    "\n",
    "A relational database is a database where the data is stored in **tables** (**Relational Data Model**). It's the main **misconception** that the word ```relational``` is connected with relationships between tables. The word **relational** is connected with **relational algebra** where **relation means a subset.** Thus, a table is a set that consists of subsets (columns) and a relation is a relationships between columns in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL** stands for Structural Query Language. It was designed for accessing the data from tables using special commands from SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SELECT\n",
    "It's the main operator that usually includes other operators such as: ```WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIMIT``` and others. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "- All commands in SQL are **case-insensitive** (e.g. ```SELECT ~ select``` but it's recommended to use upper case)\n",
    "- ```;``` is used to signal the end of SQL query or separation between queries\n",
    "- ```*``` selects everything\n",
    "- Calculations can be used ```SELECT``` (e.g. ```SELECT salary/months```)\n",
    "- To list all databases in the current db server use: ```SELECT datname FROM pg_database;```\n",
    "- ```ALIASES``` can be defined. They exist only during the query execution (e.g. ```SELECT col_name AS alias```)\n",
    "- ```ALIASES``` can't be used in ```WHERE```\n",
    "- ```ALIASES``` can be used only in ```GROUP BY```, ```ORDER BY``` and ```HAVING```\n",
    "- ```AS``` is optional\n",
    "- ```DISTINCT``` - selects only unique rows (e.g. ```SELECT DISTINCT col_1, col_2, ...```)\n",
    "- ```NULL``` always considered as ```FALSE``` and **ANY** comparison with ```NULL``` returns ```FALSE```\n",
    "- ```NULL``` values are ignored in aggregation functions\n",
    "- In ```GROUP BY``` ```NULL``` values are grouped into one group\n",
    "- ```LIMIT n OFFSET n``` is ued to skip some rows from the result query\n",
    "- ```FETCH FIRST n ROWS ONLY``` is similar to ```LIMIT```. However, ```FETCH``` is compatible with other dbs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### WHERE \n",
    "This command is used to provide conditions. Normally, the following functions are defined inside ```WHERE```:\n",
    "- ```col_name IN (value_1, value_2, ...)``` - mutiple columns can be define before IN\n",
    "- ```col_name [NOT] IN (value_1, value_2, ...)``` \n",
    "- ```col_name [NOT] BETWEEN low AND high```\n",
    "- ```col_name [NOT] LIKE 'ABC%'``` - ```%``` - sequence of zero or more characters, ```_``` - matches a single character\n",
    "- ```col_name [NOT] ILIKE 'patter'``` - case-insensitive, in patter reg_exp can be defined\n",
    "- ```col_name IS [NOT] NULL``` - checks if a value is NULL\n",
    "\n",
    "Logical operators has an order:\n",
    "1. ```NOT```\n",
    "2. ```AND```\n",
    "3. ```OR```\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```WHERE``` is used to filter rows using conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "### ORDER BY\n",
    "Allows sorting rows returned by a ```SELECT``` clause in ascending or descending order. By default ```ASC``` is used\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "```\n",
    "...\n",
    "ORDER BY col_name\n",
    "OFFSET 10 ROWS\n",
    "FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alias can be used in ```ORDER BY```\n",
    "- If two columns must be ordered, the first column is ordered first, then the second\n",
    "- ```NULL``` can be either first ```NULLS FIRST``` or last ```NULLS LAST```\n",
    "\n",
    "### JOINS\n",
    "Joins are used to combine columns from one or more tables based on values of common tables (i.e. primary key). Distinguish the following types of joins:\n",
    "- ```SELF-JOIN``` - joins a table with itself and compares rows with the same table\n",
    "- ```INNER JOIN``` - Returns a result set that contains row in the left table that match with the row in the right table\n",
    "- ```LEFT JOIN``` - Returns a complete set of rows from the left table with the matching rows if available from the right table\n",
    "- ```RIGHT JOIN``` - is opposite to left\n",
    "- ```FULL JOIN``` - returns a result set that contains all rows from both left and right tables, with the matching rows from both sides if available.\n",
    "- ```CROSS JOIN``` - produces a ```Cartesion Product NxM```\n",
    "- ```NATURAL JOIN``` - by default equals to ```INNER JOIN``` but it can be any of ```INNER, LEFT or RIGHT```\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "<img src=\"img/cross-join.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a join, the following command can be used:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT ...\n",
    "FROM ...\n",
    "INNER JOIN table_name ON table_1.column_name = table_2.column_name or INNER JOIN table_name USING (common col_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Table names are used in ```JOIN``` because some columns in both tables can have the same name\n",
    "- Instead of ```ON``` ```USING``` operator can be used (e.g. ```INNER JOIN table_1 USING (customer_id)```)\n",
    "- Word ```OUTER``` is optional and can be omitted (e.g. ```RIGHT OUTER JOIN ~ RIGHT JOIN```)\n",
    "- ```SELF-JOIN``` is often used for hierarchical data or for comparing rows within the same table\n",
    "- Tables using ```SELF-JOIN``` must have **different table names**\n",
    "- ```FULL JOINS``` combines the results of both ```LEFT``` and ```RIGHT JOIN```\n",
    "- In **MySQL** ```FULL JOIN``` doesn't exist. They use ```LEFT JOIN``` + ```UNION``` + ```RIGHT JOIN```\n",
    "- It isn't recommended using ```NATURAL JOIN``` as it may lead to unexpected results\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- More info: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-self-join/\n",
    "\n",
    "### GROUP BY\n",
    "```GROUP BY``` devides the final result returned by a query into groups. The following aggregation function can be applied:\n",
    "- ```MIN()``` - finds the min group value\n",
    "- ```MAX()``` - finds the max group value\n",
    "- ```COUNT()``` - counts number of elements in a group\n",
    "- ```COUNT(*)``` - counts all rows including ```NULL```\n",
    "- ```SUM()``` - returns the group sum\n",
    "- ```AVG()``` - returns the group avg\n",
    "\n",
    "```NULL``` values are ignored in aggregation functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**GROUPING SETS**\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows defining multiple grouping sets in the same query. Let's define ```(col_1, col_2), (col_1), (col_2) and ()``` grouping sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GROUPING SETS (\n",
    "    (col_1, col_2),\n",
    "    (col_1),\n",
    "    (col_2),\n",
    "    ()\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**GROUPING**\n",
    "\n",
    "Returns bit 0 if the argument is a member of the current grouping set and 1 otherwise. Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT GROUPING(col_name or expression),\n",
    "GROUPING(col_name or expression),\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- More info: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-grouping-sets/\n",
    "\n",
    "**CUBE**\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows generating multiple grouping sets. It creates ```2^n combinations```\n",
    "\n",
    "- More info: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-cube/\n",
    "\n",
    "**ROLL UP**\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumes a **hierarchy** among columns and generates sets that based on this hierarchy. Commonly used to calculate the aggregates of hierarchical data such as sales by year > quarter > month.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```GROUP BY``` allows applying aggregation functions on groups\n",
    "- **NULL values** are combined into a single group \n",
    "- ```HAVING``` normally used together with ```GROUP BY``` to **filter groups**\n",
    "- Several columns can be defined in ```GROUP BY```\n",
    "\n",
    "### UNION\n",
    "Combines results of seveal queries. However, queries must have the following rules:\n",
    "- Number of column and their order must match\n",
    "- Data types must be compatible\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be default ```UNION``` removes all duplicates. To retain duplicates, use ```UNION ALL```\n",
    "- ```ORDER BY``` can be used only once and usually defined in the last query\n",
    "- ```UNION``` combines rows vertically \n",
    "\n",
    "### INTERSECT\n",
    "It combines result sets of two or more ```SELECT``` statements into a single result set. It returns any rows that are available in both result sets. Queries have the same restrictions as for ```UNION```. ```ORDER BY``` must be placed at the end of a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, it's used to get the rows that **present in both tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "### EXCEPT\n",
    "Returns distinct rows from the first (left) query that are not in the output of the second (right) query. Queries have the same restrictions as for ```UNION```.```ORDER BY``` must be placed at the end of a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, it's used to get the rows from the first query that don't appear in the result set of the second query.\n",
    "\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### SUBQUERY\n",
    "It is a query nested inside another query. Normally, subqueries are used as values either to check a condition or to be passed as values for functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**ANY Operator**\n",
    "\n",
    "Compares a value to a set of values returned by a subquery. It has the following syntax ```expression operator ANY(subquery)```\n",
    "This operator must follow these rules:\n",
    "- A subquery must return **exactly one column**\n",
    "- ```ANY``` operator must be preceded by one of the following operators: ```=, <=, >, <, > and <>```\n",
    "- ```ANY``` returns ```TRUE``` if any value of the subquery meets the condition\n",
    "\n",
    "**ALL Operator**\n",
    "\n",
    "Is similar to ```ANY``` but here a value must **meet a condition for all values in a subquery.** The syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```comparison_operator ALL (subquery)```\n",
    "\n",
    "**EXISTS**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests for existence of rows in a subquery. If the subquery returns at least one row, the result of ```EXISTS``` **is true.** In case the subquery returns no row, the result is of ```EXISTS``` **is false.** It is often used with the correlated subquery. \n",
    "\n",
    "If subquery returns ```NULL```, ```EXISTS``` returns true.\n",
    "```[NOT] EXISTS(subquery)```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A subquery is always executed first\n",
    "\n",
    "**Order of SQL Commands Execution**\n",
    "\n",
    "All operators defined before ```SELECT``` **can't use column aliases**\n",
