    "### Data Types in PostgreSQL\n",
    "There are many different data types in PostgreSQL. Let's go through the main ones\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Type Changing\n",
    "To change a data type use the function:\n",
    "- ```CAST(expresion AS target_type) or expression::type``` - converts from one data type into another\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Find Out Column Data Type?\n",
    "Use ```pg_typeof(column_name)```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**\n",
    "- ```::``` is **PostgreSQL-specific** and doesn't conform to the SQL standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boolean\n",
    "This type can have 3 different values:\n",
    "- ```TRUE``` - it can be written using any of these options ('t', '1', 'yes', 'y')\n",
    "- ```FALSE``` - it can be written using any of these options ('f', '0', 'no', 'n')\n",
    "- ```NULL```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several options for defining ```BOOLEAN``` type:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name(\n",
    "    available BOOLEAN NOT NULL,\n",
    "    is_ok BOOL DEFAULT 't',\n",
    "    ...\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Impportant**\n",
    "- If no boolean value is provided for a column, it is set to ```FALSE``` by default\n",
    "\n",
    "### Characters Types: CHAR, VARCHAR and TEXT\n",
    "There are 3 primary character types:\n",
    "- ```CHARACTER(n) or CHAR(n)``` - can store up to ```n``` characters. It's **fixed-length character type**\n",
    "- ```CHARACTER VARYINGING(n) or VARCHAR(n)``` - without ```n``` it is the same as ```TEXT```\n",
    "- ```TEXT``` - stores unlimited length\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name(\n",
    "    gender CHAR,\n",
    "    name VARCHAR (10),\n",
    "    info TEXT\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impportant**\n",
    "- ```CHAR``` without ```n``` is the same as ```CHAR(1)``` \n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric\n",
    "```NUMERIC``` type stores numbers with lot of digits. Typically, this type is used for numbers that require **exactness or quantities.** In PostgreSQL, the ```NUMERIC``` and ```DECIMAL``` types are equivalent and both of them are also a part of SQL standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```NUMERIC(precision, scale)``` \n",
    "\n",
    "The precision is the total number of digits and the scale is the number of digits in the fraction part.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impportant**\n",
    "- If precision isn't important, use ```integer```, ```float``` or ```double``` as calculations on ```NUMERIC``` are slow\n",
    "- ```NUMERIC``` type can also hold a special value called ```NaN``` which stands for ```not-a-number.```\n",
    "- ```NaN``` is not equal to any number including itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integer\n",
    "To store numbers the following types can be used:\n",
    "- ```SAMLLINT``` -  integer numbers that is in the range of (-32,767, 32,767). Store ages or pages of a book\n",
    "- ```INTEGER``` - the best balance between storage size, range, and performance (-2,147,483,648, 2,147,483,647)\n",
    "- ```BIGINT``` - stores huge numbers (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808,+9,223,372,036,854,775,807)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**\n",
    "- ```INT``` and ```INTEGER``` are the same\n",
    "\n",
    "### Date\n",
    "Stores dates. PostgreSQL uses the  ```yyyy-mm-dd``` format. For working with date there are some functions:\n",
    "- ```NOW()``` - returns the current date and time. To take only date, use ```NOW()::date```\n",
    "- ```TO_CHAR()``` - outputs a value in a specific format (e.g. ```TO_CHAR(NOW()::date, 'dd/mm/yyyy')```)\n",
    "- ```AGE()``` - calculates age in years, months and days\n",
    "- ```EXTRACT(YEAR/MONTH/DAY from column)``` - extracts certain value from a date\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timestamp\n",
    "This type allows storing both date and time. Distinguis two options of timestamp:\n",
    "- ```TIMESTAMP``` - a timestamp without timezone\n",
    "- ```TIMESTAMPTZ``` - a timestamp with a timezone\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out the current time zone use: ```SHOW TIMEZONE;``` For dealing with timestamp data there are the following functions:\n",
    "- ```NOW()``` - returns date and time\n",
    "- ```CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()``` - returns date and time with the time zone\n",
    "- ```CURRENT_TIME()``` - returns time with the time zone\n",
    "- ```TIMEOFDAY()``` - returns time of a day\n",
    "- ```TIMEZONE(zone, timestamp)``` - converts a timestamp to another time zone\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interval\n",
    "The interval data type allows you to store and manipulate a period of time in years, months, days, hours, minutes, seconds, etc. Intervals can be written in the following way:\n",
    "- ```INTERVAL '1 year 2 months 3 days';```\n",
    "- ```INTERVAL '2 weeks ago';```\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "- For more info: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-interval/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time\n",
    "Allows stroing the time of day values. A time value may have a precsion up to 6 digits. The following formats of ```TIME``` can be defined:\n",
    "- ```HH:MM```\n",
    "- ```HH:MM:SS```\n",
    "- ```HHMMSS```\n",
    "- ```HH:MM:SS.ppp```\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, there is TIME data type with the time zone: ```TIME with time zone```. The following function can be used:\n",
    "- ```LOCALTIME()```\n",
    "\n",
    "This data type supports the following operators:```+, - , *```\n",
    "\n",
    "### UUID\n",
    "UUID stands for **Universal Unique Identifier** defined by RFC 4122 and other related standards. A UUID value is 128-bit quantity generated by an algorithm that make it unique in the known universe using the same algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples**\n",
    "```\n",
    "40e6215d-b5c6-4896-987c-f30f3678f608\n",
    "6ecd8c99-4036-403d-bf84-cf8400f67836\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "UUID is a sequence of 32 digits of hexadecimal digits represented in groups separated by hyphens. To create ```UUID``` the following functions can be applied:\n",
    "- ```uuid-ossp``` - standard algorithm\n",
    "- ```uuid_generate_v1()``` - based on the combination of computerâ€™s MAC address, current timestamp, and a random value\n",
    "- ```uuid_generate_v4()``` - based on random numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "```CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS \"uuid-ossp\";```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name(\n",
    "    col_name DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),\n",
    "    ...\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Array\n",
    "Every data type has its own companion array type (e.g. ```integer``` has an ```integer[]```, ```character``` has an ```character[]```)\n",
    "\n",
    "Array elements can be accessed using **slicing operator** ```col_name[index]```. To **find a value in an array**\n",
    "- ```ANY(array)``` - finds any mathces (e.g. ```WHERE 'xxx-xx-xx' = ANY(phones)```)\n",
    "\n",
    "To unpack an array into a list of rows:\n",
    "- ```unnest(array)``` - unpacks an array into rows (e.g. ```SELECT unnest(phones)...```)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hstore\n",
    "This type stores key-value pairs in a single value. To define this extension, it must be turned on:\n",
    "- ```CREATE EXTENSION hstore;```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some functions:\n",
    "- ```akeys()``` - returns all keys from an hstore\n",
    "- ```skey()``` - returns the result as a set\n",
    "- ```avals()``` - returns all values from an hstore\n",
    "- ```svals()``` - returns all values from an hstore as a set\n",
    "- ```hstore_to_json()``` - converts hstore data to JSON\n",
    "- ```each()``` - converts hstore data to set\n",
    "\n",
    "- More info: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-hstore/\n",
    "\n",
    "### JSON\n",
    "JSON data is usually used to **transport data between a server and a web application**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name(\n",
    "    info json NOT NULL,\n",
    "    ...\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This format has the following operators for helping querying JSON data:\n",
    "- ```->``` - returns JSON object filed by a key (returns JSON which can be processed by ```->>``` operator)\n",
    "- ```->>``` - returns JSON object filed by a text (returns a text which cannot be processed by ```->>``` operator)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following functions can be applied when working with JSON:\n",
    "- ```json_each()``` - allows to expand the outermost JSON object into a set of key-value pairs\n",
    "- ```json_each_text()``` - gets a set of key-value pairs as text\n",
    "- ```json_object_keys ()``` - gets a set of keys in the outermost JSON object\n",
    "- ```json_typeof()``` - returns type of the outermost JSON value as a string\n",
    "\n",
    "- More info: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-json/\n",
    "\n",
    "### User-Defined Data Types\n",
    "Besides built-in data types, PostgreSQL allows you to create user-defined data types through the following statements:\n",
    "- ```CREATE DOMAIN``` - creates a user-defined data type with constraints such as NOT NULL, CHECK, etc.\n",
    "- ```CREATE TYPE``` - creates a composite type used in stored procedures as the data types of returned values. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE DOMAIN data_type_name AS \n",
    "   VARCHAR NOT NULL CHECK (value !~ '\\s');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**To change or remove a domain**, use the ```ALTER DOMAIN``` or ```DROP DOMAIN``` respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "**To change or remove a type**, use the ```ALTER TYPE``` or ```DROP TYPE```\n",
    "\n",
    "- More info: https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-user-defined-data-types/\n",
    "\n",
    "### SERIAL\n",
    "In PostgreSQL, a sequence is a special kind of database object that generates a sequence of integers. A sequence is often used as the primary key column in a table. To define serial use ```SERIAL```. There are several options for ```SERIAL```\n",
    "- ```SMALLSERIAL``` - in range from 1 to 32.767\n",
    "- ```SERIAL``` - in range from 1 to 2,147,483,647\n",
    "- ```BIGSERIAL``` - in range from 1 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807\n",
