What is SSH?
------------
SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol and a cryptographic method that is used to securely access and manage network devices, servers, and other systems over a potentially unsecured network. SSH provides a secure way to establish a remote connection to a computer or server, allowing users to perform various tasks, such as remote administration, file transfers, and executing commands on remote systems.

Key features and components of SSH include:

* Encryption: SSH uses encryption techniques to secure the communication between the client and the server. 
  This ensures that data, including login credentials and commands, cannot be easily intercepted by eavesdroppers.

* Authentication: SSH supports various authentication methods:
	- password-based authentication
	- public key authentication
	- two-factor authentication
  allowing users to prove their identity before accessing a remote system.

* Secure Remote Access: SSH is commonly used for secure remote shell access.
  Users can log in to a remote system and interact with it as if they were physically present.

* Secure File Transfers: SSH is often used for secure file transfers 
  using tools like SCP (Secure Copy Protocol) or SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol).

* Port Forwarding: SSH supports port forwarding, allowing users to securely tunnel network traffic between local and remote hosts.
  This feature is useful for accessing services that are otherwise restricted.

* Key Pair Authentication: Public key authentication is a common and highly secure method for authenticating with SSH.
  Users generate a key pair consisting of a public key and a private key. 
  The public key is stored on the server, while the private key is kept secure on the user's local machine.


- With SSH keys, you can connect to GitHub without supplying your username and personal access token at each visit.
  You can also use an SSH key to sign commits. When you connect via SSH, you authenticate using a private key file on your local machine.

SSH key can be futher secure by using:
- Hardware security key (requires the physical hardware security key to be attached to your computer)
- ssh-agent
- pass pharse usage (requires pass phrase/password each time the key is used)

What is randomart image?
------------------------
A randomart image (Randomart Fingerprint) is a graphical representation of an SSH key. It's a visual summary or fingerprint of an SSH key that is designed to provide a quick and distinctive way to verify and compare SSH keys visually.


What is Clipboard in Linux?
---------------------------
It's a temporary data storage mechanism that allows users to copy, cut, and paste data (text, images, and files)
between different applications and within the same application. However, Linux has multiple clipboard systems, which can lead to some complexity.
The two primary clipboard systems used in Linux are:
	* Primary Selection (Primary Clipboard)
	* Clipboard (Clipboard Selection)


How to set up SSH for GitHub?
-----------------------------
- https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/about-ssh

1. Open bash and run: 
	ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "vladislavphysique@gmail.com"
	* file in which to save the key: empty -> default 
	* passpharse: empty -> default
2. Get 2 keys - public and private. Copy public.
3. Go to GitHub account and create a new SSH key
4. Add for a new SSH key public one
