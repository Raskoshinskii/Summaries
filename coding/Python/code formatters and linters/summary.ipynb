    "### Code Formatters and Linters\n",
    "Formatters and linters are tools used for ensuring that code adheres to certain standards of formatting and style, as well as for identifying potential errors or problematic patterns in the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Formatters**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Purpose:` Their primary function is to automatically format code according to a specified set of style guidelines or standards. This includes adjustments to indentation, spacing, line breaks, and other formatting aspects that make the code more readable and consistent but do not alter its functionality (e.g. Black).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linters**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Purpose:` Linters are tools used to analyze code for potential errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs without executing the code. They help in maintaining code quality and adherence to coding standards. Linters can catch syntax errors, undeclared variables, unused code, and even more complex issues like memory leaks (e.g. Flake8).\n",

    "One of the most import tools for Python code style and import check are:\n",

    "### Integreation in Development Workflow\n",
    "Both formatters and linters are integral to modern development workflows. They can be integrated into text editors, IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), or as part of continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. This integration allows developers to automatically format code and catch potential issues early in the development process, ideally before the code is even committed to a version control system.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Editors and IDEs:` Many development environments offer real-time linting and formatting, providing immediate feedback to developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Pre-commit Hooks:` Tools like Husky can be used to set up pre-commit hooks that automatically format code and run linters before code is committed, ensuring that only code that meets the project's standards is committed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `CI/CD Pipelines:` Linters and formatters can be part of the build process, running checks on code submissions and blocking merges that do not meet the required standards."
