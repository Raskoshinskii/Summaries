    "### Intro\n",
    "Once I've heard a phrase: if you want to comprehend something, teach it...so here I am almost finishing this tutorial about Object-Oriented Programming and put my hands on the next one. Data Science and machine learning fields are undoubtedly extensive and I am like you always learn something new day after day. From my perspective, OOP in Data Science isn't obligatory and you can benefit a lot with many different libraries (e.g. Scikit Learn / Keras and so forth). However, knowing OOP will give you more opportunities and flexibility in your feature projects. With the help of OOP, you will better understand relationships between objects and classes, concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism. Besides, frameworks such as PyTorch or Tensorflow will force you to face with OOP anyway. \n",
    "\n",
    "I know, it may sound terrifying but only at first sight. This tutorial isn't going to be short because I like details. They are really important. For this purpose, don't be lazy, experiment with your code and test yourself. These are probably secrete ingredients for successful learning. Alright, enough talking and let's have a look at what we are going to cover.\n",

    "### <a id=\"1\">1. What Is Object-Oriented Programming in Python</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "So what is OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm where key elements are **objects** and **classes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class**: simply an abstraction of something (e.g. a desk on which your laptop is laying is an object whereas a representation of all desks is a class)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object**: is an object (e.g. my laptop, my phone or my bottle of water are objects)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cycles, conditions and functions are elements of structural programming that allows writing not complex programs. For advanced and complex systems using object-oriented programming is almost inevitable. Even not knowing OOP paradigm in Python we utilize objects and classes which hadn't been created by us.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a id=\"1.1\">1.1 Why Instance and not Object?</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have seen that there are several names: **Instance and Object.** So..What is the difference between these definitions? Here is what I've found.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A Nitty - Gritty Detail:**\n",
    "\n",
    "All classes in Python belong to  **one class** that's called **class type**. Thus, lists, tuples, strings and others are objects of **Type class.** In order to avoid mess up a word **instance** is more appropriate for newly created classes. However, these names are interchangeable and both can be used. For better understanding, I've created the following picture:\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://imgur.com/uLDpX75\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uLDpX75.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" /></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Above picture depicts that even classes such as Int, Float..Tuple are objects of the **main metaclass Type.** If it's difficult to understand, come back to this chapter later. Just keep in mind that **everything in Python is an object.** For more info, check the link below:\n",
    "- Additional Reading about Meta Classes: https://realpython.com/python-metaclasses/\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a id=\"1.2\">1.2 Difference Between Structural Programming and OOP?</a>\n",
    "I think we have to understand the difference between these two different concepts though it might be clear. Anyway, let it be here.\n",
    "- **Structural Programming:** logic and sequence of actions are key elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object-Oriented Programming:** A program like a system of interactive objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a id=\"2\">2. Class and Object Creation</a>\n",
    "There is nothing difficult in creating a class and its object. \n",
    " - **Classes** are being created with a keyword **Class** (e.g. class class_name:)\n",
    " - **Objects** are being created according to **the following syntax:** object_name = class_name()\n",
    " \n",
    "**Unlike functions**, when a **class** is being called (invoked), it **creates an object instead of code execution**. Of course, there is no much sense in only reading, you have to practice. let's create our first class and its object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "All the following examples will be based on my favourite computer game/book the Witcher. I recommend finding **your favourite field** (e.g. games, sport, films...). You will better understand the topic by implementing OOP on own examples instead of mine. However, you can first go step by step through my examples and then reimplement with yours.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geralt from Rivia is one of the main characters of the game/book The Witcher. In OOP paradigm, Geralt is simply an object of a class and of course, there are many other characters. To be able to effectively create new characters (objects) we need a special class. let's name it **GameCharacter:**"

All we have to do is just define the main class (it's called **parental class**) with the main attributes and inherit as many classes as we want (they are called **child classes**).

    "You may say: if we can access **attributes height and \\_hair_color** and change both of them what is the difference then? Well, this is my answer: the access modifier with a single underscore only **indicates or tells** that it's protected and can be used only in a certain class and its child classes. In other words, **protected attributes just don't exist in Python.** \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, **protected and public attributes are identical.** Single underscore only tells that the attribute protected and we shouldn't use it outside the class, otherwise it may lead to unpredictable errors because it's assumed not to be touched. If it's still difficult to grasp, here is a sort of a rule of thumb: if you see attributes with a single underscore, don't call them directly because they are inner service variables.\n",

It may be really important because we may want to create an only certain number of characters for a certain location of the game. A wrong counter will introduce chaos and uncertainty.

For this purpose, you define parameters or let's name them triggers depending on which you switch the behaviour of the function (e.g. we can define the following parameters: show legend = True, show_conf_intervals = True. Switching these parameters to True/False will lead to changing the function behaviour, exactly what we want). That's probably all we need to know about methods overloading.\n",

Decorators aren't related with OOP paradigm, they came from the realm of **functional programming** (it's another programming paradigm where a program is constructed by applying only functions). In functional paradigm functions are **first-class functions.** First-class functions are just more flexible and have the following **properties:**\n",

    "Decorator is just a function which takes another function as an argument and changes or extends its logic without changing any line of code (I personally think that **extends is a more appropriate word** because decorated function must be executed anyway and only after we change the logic). Defining only a decorator once we can apply it many times and change the logic of any function, amazing, isn't it?\n",

    "### <a id=\"12\">12. OOP Advantages and Disadvantages</a>  \n",
    "In the last chapter, I would like to slightly pay your attention to the advantages and disadvantages of OOP paradigm. \n",
    "\n",
    "### <a id=\"12.1\">12.1 Advantages</a>\n",
    "Undoubtedly, the main advantage is **code consistency**. Each class has its predefined fields and methods preventing the growth of new fields and methods for new objects. An object may be considered as a container with instruments (methods) and fields - variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next one is **code reusability**. Inheritance allows to reuse, override or extend attributes and methods from parental classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last one is probably **time**. Using OOP paradigm allows creating a complex system faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### <a id=\"12.2\">12.2 Disadvantages</a>\n",
    "You have to study a particular field carefully and determine relationships between classes. Wrong relationships and classes may destruct the whole system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "What an amazing journey it was! I foresee that many of you will think that the tutorial is rather lengthy...yes it is. However, have a look at how many important topics we've covered. I hope that you've strengthened your knowledge and topics such as overloading, decorators or encapsulation won't cause any difficulties any more.
