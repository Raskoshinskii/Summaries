    "### Git\n",
    "Short tutorial about git and terminal commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Before working with Git:**\n",
    "1. Define a username for git (to tell who you are)\n",
    "- ```git config --global user.email \"email\"```\n",
    "- ```git config --global user.name \"username\"```\n",
    "2. Initialize Git in a Project folder\n",
    "- ```git init```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Commands\n",
    "- ```git --version``` - checks the current Git version\n",
    "- ```git config --list``` - lists the current Git configuration\n",
    "- ```git config --gloab``` - gloabal Git configuration\n",
    "- ```git status``` - checks the current status of the repo\n",
    "- ```git add file_name``` - adds a file for a commit\n",
    "- ```git rm -cached file_name``` - removes a file from onstage state\n",
    "- ```git commit -m \"comment\"``` - commits changes\n",
    "- ```git log``` - list all repo logs\n",
    "- ```git checkout commit_id``` - switching between commits (time machine)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Git restore \n",
    "This command restores changes in a file. There are several options for that:\n",
    "1. Restore the file state before committing:\n",
    "    - ```git restore file_name``` - resotres initial state of the file (works if the file wasn't commited)\n",
    "2. Restore the file changes from a certain commit:\n",
    "    - ```git checkout commit_id --file_name```\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Choosing file modifications:\n",
    "We can choose a certain file state by typing its commit_id. Then we can commit new changes\n",
    "- ```git checkout commit_id file_name``` - returns file modifications in a provided commit\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### Commit Cancellation (git revert): \n",
    "Only a previous commit can be cancelled without any conflicts and a commit cancellation will be presented in a log history. This command **creates a new commit** that undoes the changes from a previous commit. This command **adds new history** to the project (it doesn't modify existing history)\n",
    "- ```git revert HEAD --no-edit``` - reverts the last commit\n",
    "- ```git revert commit_id --no-edit``` - revets to a certain commit\n",
    "- ```git revert --abort``` - cancels a commit reverting\n",
    "- ```git revert --continue``` - continues a commit reverting\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Commit Deletion (git reset):\n",
    "It changes which commit a branch HEAD is currently pointing at. This command may alter existing history.\n",
    "- ```git reset commit_id --hard``` - rolls back to a certain commit (! deletes all changes and log history -danger-\n",
    "Cancel changes from a certain commit:\n",
    "1. ```git reset commit_id file_name``` - rolls back changes to a certain commit (it changes the commit history)\n",
    "2. ```git checkout file_name``` - select current state of the file\n",
    "3. Commit new changes!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Git ignore\n",
    "Ignores files provided in the file.\n",
    "1. Create a file in the root folder (e.g. .gitignore)\n",
    "2. Enumerate Files/Folders to be ignored in the file\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Git add options\n",
    "- ```git add file``` (e.g. git add index.html) # one file\n",
    "- ```git add *.file_extension``` (e.g. git add *.html) # all files\n",
    "- ```git add !*.file_extension``` (e.g. git add !*.html) # all files except html files\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- ```git add folder``` (e.g. git add css/) # one folder\n",
    "- ```git add !folder\\file``` (e.g. git add !css/index.html) # all files in css except html index.html\n",
    "- ```git add .``` # adds everything into the local repository\n",
    "- ```git add *```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Git log options \n",
    "- ```git log / git log --oneline```\n",
    "- ```git log --pretty=oneline --max-count=number_of_commits to show``\n",
    "- ```git log --pretty=oneline --all``` - lists all commits\n",
    "- ```git log --pretty=oneline --author='author_name'```\n",
    "- ```git log --pretty=format:'%h - %s : %ad [ %an ]'--date=short``` - another way of displaying the log info\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Git rebase \n",
    "When you are working in another branch and want to add some data from the master branch use **git rebase** instead of git merge. It pulls changes and add them on top without chronological order\n",
    "- ```git rebase branch_name```\n",
    "- ```git pull --rebase origin master``` - adds commits in chronological order. Better use this one to prevent conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Git stash\n",
    "It creates sort of a basket (stash) for storing the current **changes** of the file. For instance, we've made changes locally and want to add some files from a remote repo where some chages also has been made. Using the command **git pull --rebase** won't work because of the conflicts. However, the remote changes can be obtained using the command **git pull** but this will lead to future conflicts. In order to use the command **git pull --rebase** we have to use **git stash** first to store local changes then use **git pull --rebase** to obtain remote changes and return the previous changes from the stash using **git stash pop**\n",
    "- ```git stash``` - stores current **modifications** in the basket (stash)\n",
    "- ```git stash pop``` - extracts previous modifications from the stash\n",
    "- ```git stash list``` - list all modifications in the stash\n",
    "- ```git stash show``` - shows last modifications in the stash\n",
    "- ```git stash drop``` - deletes the last modification from the stash\n",
    "- ```git stash clear``` - clears all stash\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Git reflog:\n",
    "This command allows travelling in time because it lists all made command. Then use absolute or relative link to choose the desired state.\n",
    "- ```git reflog``` - lists history command\n",
    "- ```git checkout commit_id```  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Useful commands:\n",
    "- ```git commit --amend``` - changes the comment for last commit (Vim will be opened where the comment can be changed)\n",
    "\n",
    "If forgot to add a file to the last commit\n",
    "1. ```git add missed-file.txt```\n",
    "2. ```git commit --amend``` \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conflics\n",
    "Conflicts are appearing when git doesn't know which exactly changes must be saved (it doesn't understand the logic). The main idea is to manually choose what we need in the files and olny after tell the git that conflict has been solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve a conflict:\n",
    "1. Check the location of the conflict using: ```git status```\n",
    "2. Open a conflict file and choose what we need\n",
    "3. Use ```git add```\n",
    "4. Again a conflict command\n",
    "\n",
    "Conflicts are often appearing using the following commands:\n",
    "- ```git revert```\n",
    "- ```git rebase```\n",
    "- ```git merge```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interesting fact:\n",
    "Only changes in files can be seen in git status. If after committing I open a file, modify something and then roll back changes, it won't be tracked by git status though I've already opened the file!"

    "#### Git Branches\n",
    "The concept may be described as follows:\n",
    "Imagine we were given a task: create an admin panel for our website. Git already initialized in our project (website). If we will be working in the main branch we always will be getting commits from other developers and other developers will be getting our commits (not cool because creates chaos in the system)\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "To prevent this exists branches:\n",
    "* Branch - is an individual fork from the project where this time only modifications from our task(admin panel) can be seen\n",
    "It doesn't disturb the main project branch. \n",
    "\n",
    "After creating a new branch, the current state of the branch is copying into the new branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a Git is initialized, the main branch (master) is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### New Branch Creation\n",
    "- ```git branch branch_name```\n",
    "- ```git checkout -b branch_name``` # creates a branch and automatically redirects to it\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Branch Deletion\n",
    "- ```git branch -d branch_name``` - deletes a branch ( -d is an alias for --delete. It deletes an only merged branches)\n",
    "- ```git branch -D branch_name``` - deletes a branc ( -D is alias an alias for --delete --force, which deletes the branch \"irrespective of its merged status.\")  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Branch Checkout\n",
    "- ```git status``` # tells on which branch we are\n",
    "- ```git branch or git branch -a```\n",

    "\n",
    "#### List All Branches\n",
    "- ```git branch -a```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Branches Merging\n",
    "1. Come back to master branch to which you want to merge (target branch)\n",
    "2. Merge branches:\n",
    "- ```git merge branch_name```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Branch Renaiming\n",
    "- ```git branch -m old_name new_name```\n",
    "\n",
    "After merging all previous branches still exist\n",
    "If conflicts are happening:\n",
    "1. Modify coflict files\n",
    "2. Use git add \n",
    "3. use git commit without a comment\n",
    "It add commits in chronological order"

    "For cloned project there is no need to define git init command, it is already there!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pull only new modifications from remote repository:\n",
    "- ```git pull``` - may lead to future conflicts\n",
    "- ```git pull --rebase``` - stable because takes into account the commit order\n",

    "#### What Is Origin\n",
    "Origin is the name of the remote repo. This name is given by GitHub  by default.\n",
