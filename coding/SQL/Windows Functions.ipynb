    "1. Partitions are made. If ```PARTITION BY``` isn't provided, the whole dataset is treated as a single partition\n",

    "**Important**\n",
    "- A window function always performs the calculation on the result set after the ```JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY and HAVING``` clause and before the final ```ORDER BY``` clause in the evaluation order.\n",
    "- ```PARTITION BY``` clause is optional. If you skip it, the window function will treat the whole result set as a single partition.\n",
    "- ```PARTITION BY``` divides rows into multiple partitions to which a function is applied."
