    "PL/pgSQL is a **procedural programming language** for the PostgreSQL database system. It has many procedural elements e.g., control structures, loops, and complex computations to extend standard SQL. It allows you to develop complex functions and stored procedures in PostgreSQL that may not be possible using standard SQL. It was designed to:\n",
    "- Create user-defined functions, stored procedures, and triggers.\n",
    "- Extend standard SQL by adding control structures such as if, case, and loop statements.\n",
