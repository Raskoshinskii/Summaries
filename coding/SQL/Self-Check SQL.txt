**Conditional Expressions in PostgreSQL**
- What does COALESCE function? What will be returned if all arguments are equal to NULL?
- For what we usually apply COALESCE function?
- How does NULLIF function work?
- How does CASE function work?

**Constraints in PostgreSQL**
- What the main constraints for a table do you know?
  - Tell about FOREIGN KEY, PRIMARY KEY, CHECK, GENERATED AS IDENTITY
  - Can a table have many primary keys?

**Data Types in PostgreSQL**
- How to change a data type of a column in two ways?
- How to find out a column data type?
- Main data types:
  - Boolean (what values can be set)
  - Character Types
  - Main pros and cons of NUMERIC data type
    - Is NUMERIC and DECIMAL the same?
  - INT, FLOAT, DOUBLE
  - DATE + NOW(), TO_CHAR(), AGE(), EXTRACT()
  - TIMESTAMP
  - INTERVAL
  - TIME

**Dealing with Strings**
- String concatenation (CONCAT, CONCAT_WS, ||)
- Substring Extraction (LEFT, RIGHT, SUBSTRING)
- String Splitting (SPLIT_PART)
- Adding new symbols in a string (LPAD, RPAD)
- String trimming and replacing (TRIM, LTRIM, REPLACE)

**Tables**
- Two types of tables
- For what we use table aliases?
- Is temp table visible for other sessions?
- Create a table with data types and constraints
- Change a table:
  - add column, drop column, rename column, alter column data type
  - rename a table, delete a row, change a value in a table
  - add data into a table
- Difference between delete and truncate

**Fundamentals**
- What is RDM (Relational Data Model)?
- Is SQL sensitive to case (upper/lower case)
- Can we use calculations in SELECT (formulas, statistics)
- Tell about DISTINCT
- What do you know about NULL values (aggregation, grouping)
- LIMIT/OFFSET and FETCH FIRST n ROWS
- Main commands for WHERE (IN, ILIKE, BETWEEN, IS NULL)
- Order of logical operators (AND, OR, NOT)
- What happens if we have several columns in ORDER BY
- Tell about indexes in SQL (Intuition)
- Tell about triggers (Intuition)
- Tell about views (Intuition)

**Joins**
  - SELF-JOIN, INNER JOIN, LEFT/RIGHT JOIN, FULL JOIN, CROSS-JOIN
  - Does self-join exist in MySQL?
- Difference between COUNT() and COUNT(*)
- What happens with NULL values in aggregation functions?
- Difference between UNION and UNION ALL. Requirements for UNION, where ORDER BY must be placed?
- INTERSECT and EXCEPT
- Subquery and ANY, ALL, EXISTS
- Order of SQL commands execution
