    "### Constraints in PostgreSQL\n",
    "When a table is being created, **table constraints must be defined** for each column. The following constraints can be defined:\n",
    "- ```NOT NULL``` – ensures that values in a column cannot be NULL.\n",
    "- ```UNIQUE``` – ensures the values in a column unique across the rows within the same table.\n",
    "- ```PRIMARY KEY``` – a primary key column uniquely identify rows in a table. A table can have one and only one primary key. \n",
    "- ```FOREIGN KEY``` – Unlike the primary key, a table can have many foreign keys.\n",
    "- ```CHECK``` - ensures the data must satisfy a boolean expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Key\n",
    "A **Primary Key** is a unique filed in a table like id. It's a good practice to add a ```PRIMARY KEY``` to every table. A **primary key** constraint is the combination of a ```NOT NULL``` and ```UNIQUE``` constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, a primary key is created during a **table creation:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "    col_name data_type PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    ...\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If a primary key consists of **several columns:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "    col_name data_type constraint,\n",
    "    PRIMARY KEY (col_2, col_3)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Only in rare cases a primary key **must be added:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```ALTER TABLE table_name ADD PRIMARY KEY (col_name)```\n",
    "\n",
    "To define **autoincremented primary key**, use: ```ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN col_1 SERIAL PRIMARY KEY```\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove a primary key, use: ```ALTER TABLE table_name DROP CONSTRAIT table_name_pkey```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Foreign Key\n",
    "It's a column or a group of columns that **reference the primary key of another table.** The table that contains the foreign key is called **the referencing table or child table.** And the table referenced by the foreign key is called **the referenced table or parent table.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, a foreign key is created during a **table creation:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name(\n",
    "    col_name data_type constraints,\n",
    "    foreign_key_name data_type,\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY(foreign_key_name)\n",
    "    REFERENCES table_name(col_name)\n",
    "    ON DELETE {CASCADE | RESTRICT}\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "Since the primary key is rarely updated, the ```ON UPDATE``` action **is not often used in practice.** Delete action is usually: ```ON DELETE CASCADE```. Automatically deletes all the referencing rows in the child table when the referenced rows in the parent table are deleted.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CHECK \n",
    "Uses a Boolean expression to evaluate the values before they are inserted or updated to the column. If values **pass the check, they are inserted.** Using the ```CHECK``` constraint, you can make sure that data is updated to the database correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, check is used during **table creation**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "    salary numeric CHECK (salary > 0)\n",
    "    ...\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding ```CHECK``` to an existing table:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ALTER TABLE table_name \n",
    "ADD CONSTRAINT constraint_name\n",
    "CHECK (salary > 0 AND ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### UNIQUE\n",
    "Maintains the uniqueness of the data correctly. Every time you insert a new row, it checks if the value is already in the table. It rejects the change and issues an error if the value already exists. The same process is carried out for updating existing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using unique during table creation. Pay attention that **several options of UNIQUE are possible:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name (\n",
    "    email VARCHAR (50) UNIQUE,\n",
    "    card_id numeric,\n",
    "    UNIQUE (card_id)\n",
    "    ...\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating ```UNIQUE``` constraint for **multiple columns**\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name(\n",
    "    col_1 data_type,\n",
    "    col_2 data_type,\n",
    "    UNIQUE(col_1, col_2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### NOT NULL\n",
    "In database theory, ```NULL``` represents unknown or information missing. It has the following properties:\n",
    "- ```NULL``` is not the same as an empty string or the number zero.\n",
    "- It doesn't equal to anything, even itself.\n",
    "- To check whether a value is NULL or not, use the keyword ```IS NULL```\n",
    "\n",
    "Declaring ```NOT NULL``` column during **table creation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE table_name(\n",
    "    age numeric NOT NULL,\n",
    "    ...\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding ```NOT NULL``` to an existing table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ALTER TABLE table_name\n",
    "ALTER COLUMN col_name_1 SET NOT NULL,\n",
    "ALTER COLUMN col_name_2 SET NOT NULL,\n",
    "...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```NOT NULL``` property can be defined using ```CHECK``` (e.g. ```CHECK(col_name IS NOT NULL)```)\n",
    "\n",
    "### GENERATED AS IDENTITY\n",
    "```GENERATED AS IDENTITY``` constraint is the SQL is similar to ```SERIAL``` column. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ```col_name type GENERATED { ALWAYS | BY DEFAULT } AS IDENTITY (START WITH n INCREMENT BY z)```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**\n",
    "- A single column can have multiple constraints\n",
    "- **Only one primary key** can be defined for a single table but **several columns** may have the same primary key\n",
    "- **Multiple foreign keys** can defined for a single table\n",
    "- Never use equal operator ```=``` to compare a value with ```NULL``` because it always returns ```NULL```"
